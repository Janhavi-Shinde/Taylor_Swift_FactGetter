Taylor Swift Fact Finder



To start, run the command
$ ruby bin/executable.rb

Then, follow the instructions!

You can select any song from the Reputation album and the CLI app will deliver an interesting fact about your chosen song! All thanks to web-scraping!

This CLI app also uses the Taylor Swift random lyric generator API, so you can choose to find out a fun fact about the randomly generates lyric's song if you don't like the Reputation album particurlarly :)

NOTE (4/08/22)
The website I scrape from has set up a captcha, due to which I am having issues scraping content. You may see an error message pop up when you try and select a song. That error message will have a link that opens up in your browser; if you click that link and fill out the I'm not a robot/captcha, and run the app again (while having that browser open), it will then work. I will be uploading a instruction/explanation video by 8/08/2022 but in the meantime if you have any issues with this, I'm happy to help :)
