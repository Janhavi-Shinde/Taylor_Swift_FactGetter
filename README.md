# ruby_final_project
To start, run the command
$ ruby bin/executable.rb

Then, follow the instructions!

Basically, you can select any song from the Reputation album and the CLI app will deliver an interesting fact about your chosen song! All thanks to web-scraping!

This CLI app also uses the Taylor Swift random lyric generator API, so you can choose to find out a fun fact about the randomly generates lyric's song if you don't like the Reputation album particurlarly :)

NOTE (4/08/22)
The website I scrape from has set up a captcha, due to which I am having issues scraping content. You may see an error message pop up when you try and select a song. That error message will have a link that opens up in your browser; if you click that link and fill out the I'm not a robot/captcha, and then try running the app again (while having the  browser open), it will then work. I will be solving this bug soon, but haven't gotten round to it yet as I'm working on my final project. If you have any issues with this, I'm happy to help :)
